26,"Governments – and the public sector more broadly – will no longer be able to plug the funding gap for green infrastructure projects without private sector help. The private sector has the expertise, funds and experience critical to the success of these projects. As a result, the private sector will have to invest in the new infrastructure needed for sustainable development goals. This will include newer asset classes, like advanced nuclear power, electric vehicle infrastructure, floating renewables and carbon capture.

We need to do something about this urgently, as over 85% of today’s buildings will still be standing in 2050, when Europe must be climate neutral. Improving our homes is also an effective response to high energy prices – the worst-performing buildings in the EU consume many times more energy as new or properly renovated ones.
